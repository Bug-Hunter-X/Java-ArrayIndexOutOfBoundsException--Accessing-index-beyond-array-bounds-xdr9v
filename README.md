This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates a common programming error: the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  The `bug.java` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.java` provides a corrected version.  The error arises from an off-by-one error in a loop's iteration condition, leading to an attempt to access an element beyond the array's valid index range. The solution demonstrates how to correctly iterate within the bounds of the array.
